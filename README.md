## MatthewMillerPortfolio

### A personal portfolio website built with HTML (JSX), SCSS, JavaScript, and React.

Project is currently in development. Mobile viewer functionality and responsivity is in progress.

#### To use:
Clone down this repository - you will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.
All other devDependencies can found in `package.json`.
I use `yarn` as preference to `npm`. To install `yarn`, use `npm install yarn`.

#### To run test build:

`yarn build`
This will compile your current build to be viewed but not automatically update.

#### To run test server:

`yarn run serve`
This will compile your current build and also automatically update the browser.

#### To view App:

`localhost:8080`
Visit this in your browser of choice to see the output.
